# Bluetooth Low Energy in C++ with nRF Microcontrollers

## Chapter 12: Project: Echo Server


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy in C++ with nRF Microcontrollers_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using Arduino 101.

This chapter teaches how to create an Echo Server that receives text and responds with the same text to the connected Client.
